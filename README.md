# Hi there, I'm banguku! 👋

I'm a software developer who loves building things with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**. My favorite project so far is a Discord bot—because who doesn't love automating a little chaos?

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build (occasionally useless) side projects for fun
- Tinker with bots, scripts, and anything that can be automated
- Explore new tech stacks just for the thrill of it

## 🎮 Hobbies

- Watching anime and keeping up with new releases
- Making random, mostly unnecessary coding projects
- Enjoying the process of learning and breaking things

## 🌱 Currently Experimenting With

- New ways to make my Discord bot even more unpredictable
- Integrating anime APIs into my silly side projects

Thanks for stopping by! If you want to chat about anime, bots, or weird project ideas, feel free to reach out or check out my repos.
